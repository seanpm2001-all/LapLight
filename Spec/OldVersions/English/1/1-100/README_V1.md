# Laptop Flashlight specification

- [x] Modifiable (colors can be changed, white must always be a supported color)

- [x] Optional add-on to a laptop (similar to a CD drive being optional)

- [x] 5 light levels

- [x] A slide over cover

- [x] System warnings for when the flashlight is on (Linux, Windows, MacOS, BSD, etc.)

- [x] No Internet/IoT support by default, this MUST be optional. If you include it, there must be an easy way to turn it off, and the method must be do-able without an Internet, Bluetooth, Ethernet, LAN, or other network connection.

- [x] The flashlight must be on the lid side of the device, not the screen side. You wouldn't want a flashlight that just shines directly into your eyes.
